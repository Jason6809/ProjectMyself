                    The biggest challenge we faced during the development is to make the application available on all kinds of platform such as Android, iOS, Windows and Web.

                    However, we able to overcome this by using Ionic Framework as our cross-platform solution.

                    Ionic Framework is an easy-to-use cross-platform application development framework based on the current most popular language, JavaScript. With Ionic Framework, we able to produce an application that available on 4 platform which is, Web, Android, iOS and Windows with only one codebase. In addition, we used Laravel as a backend API endpoint, AWS as hosting services, Firebase for real-time event, and Stripe as a payment gateway.

                    Also worth mentioning that, our team used Agile Development as our software
                    development lifecycle, which is also proposed by me. I proposed to use the Agile Development lifecycle is because our team is a small 6 member team and my boss wished this project can be launch as soon as possible.
